## Introduction to Kubernetes
Kubernetes is a portable, extensible, and open-source platform which allows management of containerized workloads and
services. These services facilitiate both declarative configuration and automation, as Kubernetes has a rapidly growing
ecosystem. Kubernetes was open-soruced by Google in 2014, and is now maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation.


Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
