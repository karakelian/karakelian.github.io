## History of Bootstrap
Bootstrap started originally as a framework at Twitter which aimed to bolster the consistency of internal tools. Before its implementation, there were many libraries that were used to develop interfaces, and this led to many inconsistencies and high maintenance burdens according to Twitter developers. After only a few months of development, developers at Twitter began contribution to what would become the Bootstrap project as part of a Hack Week. It was renamed from "Twitter Blueprint" to "Bootstrap" shortly after and became a released open-source project in August of 2011.

## Advantages and Disadvantages
Advantages of Bootstrap include time consumption, as Bootstrap has great documentation that allows for detailed specifications on components. This allows developers to quickly find documentation pertaining to issues and quickly resolve them. Cross-browser bugs are also not as prevalent with Bootstrap as being an open-source project allows any developer to submit code to fix current issues. This allows for faster consistency among new bugs and fixes. Lastly, Bootstrap is becoming a large part of the design framework, and knowing how to deploy it will be a great skill to add on to your resume.

Some of the disadvantages of Bootstrap include a style overrides. This is mainly due to SASS file compiling errors. This also can lead to developers creating bland interfaces as more work and time needs to go in further customization each page to steer away from the `default` style that Bootstrap offers. There is also a slight learning curve that may be difficult for new developers to grasp when first starting off.
